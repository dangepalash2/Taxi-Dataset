# Taxi-Dataset
The purpose of this report is to study and provide analysis of the New York City Taxi. The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) undertake the responsibility of forHire vehicles in New York City. With over 1,00,000 vehicles under TLC, bound to generate data which can give us an InSite on the rides, locations and passengers. With the data, I expect to explore when do the customers usually tend to take the cab. The study first analyses the outcome of the volume in which customers prefer to take the cab. This is differentiated with different seasons, weekly and daily volume over a year. I further plan to analyse start and end locations of the highest travelled passengers of the NY City Taxi. Accordingly, this report describes visual significance of the data captured and the actions that surrounded them. The result, is the expectation of a compelling conclusion to the number of passengers opted for NY Cabs over the year and popular locations where passengers start their trip and end it.
